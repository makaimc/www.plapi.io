# Introduction
The [Programming Languages web API](https://api.plapi.io) (I just refer
to it as "Plapi") provides programmatic access to curated lists of
[programming languages](https://api.plapi.io/programming-languages),
[code libraries](https://api.plapi.io/libraries) and 
[tutorials](https://api.plapi.io/tutorials).

The [source code to the API](https://github.com/makaimc/plapi) is open 
sourced under the MIT license, as is 
[the code for this website](https://github.com/makaimc/www.plapi.io).
